# School-Timetable-2024-2025
## Project Description

This project recreates the 2024/2025 academic year school timetable using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It demonstrates knowledge of:
- Semantic HTML tables
- CSS styling and fixed layouts
- Accessibility best practices (headers, scope attributes, alt text)

The timetable includes weekdays (Monday–Friday), periods between 8:00–16:
, with breaks, lunch, and end-of-day activities highlighted. Some cells are merged using `rowspan` and `colspan` to match the real timetable layout.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Used `<th>` with `scope="col"` and `scope="row"` for clear navigation with screen readers.
- Added a `<caption>` and `summary` to the table for assistive technologies.
- Break, Lunch, and Activities are visually highlighted with distinct background colors.

## How to View
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Ensure `style.css` is in the same folder so styles load correctly.
3. To preview the project online, upload the files to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages.

## Validation
- HTML validated using the **W3C Markup Validation Service**.
- CSS validated using the **W3C CSS Validation Service**.
